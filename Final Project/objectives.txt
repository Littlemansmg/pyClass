Not an order, just a list of things that need to be done.

1. GUI √
2. DB for information √
    ID, time start, start money, added money, stop time, stop money.
3. Card, Deck, Hand, and Session class
    Card class
        __str__ to display cards suits/points
        Just put cards from deck into hand?
        hand == 2 card objects
    Deck class
        make the deck, shuffle, and deal
    Hand class
        store each players hand
        hit count(Why?) get points
    Session class
        Store session data to put into DB
        See above to see what to store.
4. Locale module
    display money
5. Betting
    player starts with x money - 100 I guess
    min bet 5 max 1000
    can't bet more than current money
    betting is 1.5 aka 3:2
6. Actually use Try excepts to handle all errors.


Questions:
1. Does he just want section 4 or a snapshot of each section?
    A. If you do want each section, it's mentioned in section 1 to get money from a CSV file.
        It's a CSV file called `money.txt`, so which is it? Do you want a CSV or a txt file.
2. If the logic for Hits are in the Hand class, does the rest of the logic, like standing,
    just go into another file or just find a class to fit it in?
3. Why do we need to count how many cards are in each hand via Hand class
